## Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 28, 2026

Coital Comrade is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our data practices for the Coital Comrade mobile application.

### Data Collection

**We collect no data whatsoever.**

Coital Comrade does not collect, transmit, store, or share any of your personal information or usage data. All information you enter into the app remains exclusively on your device.

### Data Storage

All data you create within Coital Comrade—including partner profiles, encounter logs, notes, and any other information—is stored locally on your device only. This data:

- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted to any servers
- Is not backed up to any cloud services by the app
- Remains under your complete control

### Third-Party Services

Coital Comrade does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services. The app does not contain any code that sends data to external services.

### Data Export

You have the ability to export your data as a CSV file at any time. When you choose to export your data, it is saved to your device's local storage. How you choose to share or store that exported file is entirely up to you.

### Your Control

You have complete control over your data:

- You can delete all data at any time through the app settings
- Uninstalling the app will remove all associated data from your device
- No data recovery is possible once deleted, as we have no copies of your information

### Changes to This Policy

If we ever change our data practices, we will update this Privacy Policy and notify users through the app. However, our commitment to not collecting any user data is fundamental to Coital Comrade's design and purpose.
