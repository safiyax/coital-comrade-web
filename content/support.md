## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is my data private?

Yes, completely. All data is stored locally on your device. We have no servers, no accounts, and no way to access your information. See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy/) for details.

### Can I export my data?

Yes. You can export all your data as a CSV file at any time from within the app.

### I lost my data after deleting the app

Since all data is stored locally on your device, deleting the app will remove all associated data. We recommend exporting your data regularly if you want to keep a backup.
